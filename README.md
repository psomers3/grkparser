# grk_patient_sorter
A quick GUI script to pseudo-anonymize patient videos for use in the GRK.

**Source directory** &mdash; the highest level folder that will be recursively searched for patient folders with videos or image data

**Destination directory** &mdash; the folder that contains the GRK anonymized patient storage

**Excel file** &mdash; the excel file with the record of GRK number with patient ID. This excel file needs to have a sheet named "Patienten" where the data is stored. See the example excel sheet. **The file cannot be open when running this script**
